Description: Two functions to calculate intra- and interspecific pairwise distances, evaluate DNA barcoding identification error and calculate an ad hoc distance threshold for each particular reference library of DNA barcodes. Specimen identification at this ad hoc distance threshold (using the best close match method) will produce identifications with an estimated relative error probability that can be fixed by the user (e.g. 5%).
